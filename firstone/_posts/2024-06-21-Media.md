Ok, so before setting up your media server, you really need to start building up the media library. Otherwise your brand new plex media server is going to be an expensive paper weight. 

Little bit about plex - 
Plex is a nice UI over your existing media. It cannot do more than this. It cannot play content over internet which you dont own. So if you are hoping to mimic Kodi/IPTV behaviour, dont need to proceed further. 
Good thing about plex though - you can access your home content anywhere but there are two pre requisites - 
* Network connection
* Hardware capability

## Hardware - 
* Storage - start with 4 TB should last for more than couple of years. 4K/8K rips usually are huge
    - No Hard Drives
    - [NVME][amazon-nvme] is preferable 
    - or any WD [SSDs][amazon-ssd]
* Compute - we need some form of compute to run the plex server. Following are some options. 

    | Budget    | Recommended |            Performance |
    | ----------| ------------| -----------------------|
    | Low    | [Raspberry Pi][pi]| Remote Play not supported
    | Medium | [Nvidia Shield][shield]| Nice snappy performance
    | Medium | [Any decent Mini Pc][mini] | Supports more than 2-3 streams parallel
    | High   | Any Old Laptop | Full functionality

 ## Software
 ### OS
 Any Operating System which you are comfortable with. If you are using a PI you dont have any other option than to use a flavor of linux. It runs Raspberry Pi distro based on Debian/Ubuntu

 ### Now the Imp stuff - Build up your media
 You need a vpn from here. Any half decent vpn works as well, but if you are going to download lots of 4k media then check the speeds promised by the vpn provider. I am assuming you already subscribe to a vpn provider.  You can use literally anything including rolling up your own. The key is to encrypt where you are going so that the ISP doesnt know. 

 I've been using PIA for last 10 years.

 Torrent software - I use [qbit][qbit]

 ### Start
 * Connect the vpn to any country in EU which has low latency (depends on the vpn provider)
 * Now browse to h t t p s :// p i r a t e p r o x y . l i v e without spaces 
 * Search for any title you want
 * Add 2160p to the end of the search term if you want to download 4k content

See below for reference. Please browse to the below site after installing qbit software above
